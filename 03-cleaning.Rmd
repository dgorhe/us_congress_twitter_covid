# Data transformation

## Congress Members Tweets
We decided to retain all of the values from this dataset because the tweets labeled as missing values were not technically absent or missing. That or the fact that so many are missing and thus the feature itself is ignored (e.g. geolocation). Most of the cleaning was done when the data was being retrieved via the Twitter API. We used the new Tweepy python package and Python 3.9 to retrieve tweets from Twitter's V2 API endpoint. This new version of the endpoint provides features which were not utilized for this analysis. We chose the V2 endpoint to ensure that others can replicate our findings for as long as possible. The old API is not yet deprecated so the tweet retrieval is probably translatable to the V1.1 API although this has not been tested. The web scraping script can be found in the repository. The dataset of tweets is approximately 100 megabytes (Mb) and contains roughly 500,000 tweets across all US Congress Members.

## Google's Changes in Mobility Data
This data was provided directly by Google and can be found (here)[https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/]. The US data lists relative changes in mobility at the state and county level. We will only use data from states because for most states multiple counties correspond to a single congressional district. The more important problem occurs when a single county is represented by multiple congressional districts (e.g Los Angeles County in California). If the many-to-one relationship only existed in one direction. We could theoretically, manually map congressional districts to counties or vice versa in a consistent manner. We could assume that counties with many districts have representatives who are equally influential but that assumption could sway our results significantly. For example, if we aggregate representatives from multiple districts into the county shared by those districts, we are assuming the representatives are acting independently which is a tenuous assumption at best. Representatives from the same county likely have similar constituents and goals so any uniformity from their tweet content would suggest a stronger relationship between mobility and tweets than would be otherwise. In the future, people could experiment with different weightings to make this corresponding more representative.
