Ratther unsurprisingly, there seems to be little correlation between the number of tweets by members of the US Congress and changes in mobility in their respective areas. However, something that is different across categories is the variance in the data. For example, the Parks & Recreation category has the highest variation followed by the Transit Station. It makes sense for the Residential and Workplaces categories to have low variance. One possible explanation is that Parks & Recreation encompasses a large variety of activities and settings. The outliers and difference in variance is a rather interesting phenomenon in this visualization. An interesting follow-up to this plot is the question: are the outliers across location categories the same congress members? It is possible that these are different outliers across each category. But there are 3 consistent outliers across the following categories: Grocery & Pharmacy, Parks & Recreation, Retail, and Transit Station.

```{r common_outliers, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide', fig.keep='all', message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
# Loading initial CSV
outliers <- tweets

# Filtering out based on where outliers appear visually in first correlation plot
outliers <- filter(outliers, (parks_percent_yearly_change > 75) | (parks_percent_yearly_change < -40))
outliers <- filter(outliers, (transit_stations_yearly_percent_change < -50))
outliers <- filter(outliers, (retail_and_recreation_percent_change_from_baseline < -30))
outliers <- filter(outliers, (grocery_and_pharmacy_yearly_percent_change < -20))

# Counting tweets by congress member and whether or not tweet was labeled as "covid-19" related
outliers <- outliers %>%
  group_by(full_name_of_member, covid_label) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

# Bar chart of tweets for outlier members
ggplot(outliers, 
  aes(x = reorder(full_name_of_member, -count), y = count, fill = covid_label)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
  xlab("Name of Congress Member") + 
  ylab("Number of Tweets")
```
The outliers in the aforementioned categories are in fact the same 3 outliers! Most of them have non-covid related tweets which could be why they are so influential. Mazie K. Hirono is senator from Hawaii, Brian Schatz is a senator from Ohio, and Ed Case is a representative from Hawaii. Since two senators are from Hawaii, this suggests a geographic element to the extreme changes in mobility relative to other representatives. That being said, having a member from Ohio casts doubt on a solely geographic explanation. We can look at the content of their tweets a bit more closely to uncover any potential patterns. Specifically, let us look at the content of their tweets for COVID adjacent terms (masks, vaccines, etc).

```{r congress_sentiment, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide', fig.keep='all', message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
# Selecting relevant columns of tweet data

# Filtering down to our outliers

    df[name] <- df %>% apply(1, function(row) {
    for (kw in keywords) {
      if (grepl(kw, tolower(row['tweet_content']), fixed = TRUE)) {
        return(TRUE);
      }
    }
    return(FALSE);
  });
  return(df);
}

# Combining sentiment booleans into single column

                   cols = -c("full_name_of_member", "tweet_content"), 
                   names_to = "Sentiment_Category", 
                   values_to = "Present")

# Removing tweet itself and casting booleans to integers
df <- df[, !names(df) %in% c("tweet_content")]
df$Present <- as.numeric(df$Present) 

# Getting 
df <- df %>% 
  group_by(full_name_of_member, Sentiment_Category) %>% 
  summarise_at(vars(Present), list(name = sum))

ggplot(df, aes(x = name, y = reorder(Sentiment_Category, +name))) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", orientation='y') + 
  facet_wrap(~full_name_of_member) +
  xlab("Number of Tweets in 2020") +
  ylab("Sentiment Category")
```
While it is no surprise that vaccines, testing, and masks were included among these outliers, it is interesting to note that social distancing is not as frequently mentioned. Perhaps this is a clue to the types of outreach and education that sticks with constituents. Masks and testing appear to be the most consistently frequent sentiments across the congress members' tweets. Herd immunity is also absent from these outliers' tweets.
