If we take a look at our correlations coefficient we can see two different stories. When it comes to number of covid-related tweets in relation to the number of deaths we have low correlation . The correlation coefficient is this case is 0.21(corr2), which means there is a positive correlation. However if we take a look at the correlation test cortest2 we can see that the pvalue is 0.1951, hence even with a confidence level of 10% we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the correlation happened by chance.
On the other hand, we can analyse our correlation of cases and number of tweets.In corr1 we have stored a correlation value of -0.48 and the associated pvalue is 0.0025, which means we can reject our null hypothesis and state that there is a correlation between the number of cases and number of tweets. 
The surprising feature, is that the correlation is negative, where common sense may suggest there would be a positive correlation.In other words, we may expect, higher number of cases could trigger a higher number of people talking about it.
The truth may be another one. We suspect that the real correlation may be linked to the dates itself. As we can see in the interval chart, we have that in the first 5 weeks (start date 4/1/2020), people were more scared and more prone to talk about it, then as the virus became usual among our lives, the covid tweets chat started to slowly but steadily decline. Even in the last part of the graph, when cases started taking off exponentially, the number of covid related tweets continued to slow.

<!-- ![f](./nicolo_images/tweetcounts_retailmobility_correlation.png) -->

We can observe that we have a negative correlation between the retail and recreation activity movement and the number of tweets. Which means that in general, the more tweet are written, the less mobility was experienced for the purposes aforementioned. The cause of this may rely in again more in the timeline of events. The biggest mobility changes may have occurred at the start of the pandemics in USA. Therefore,we know the highest number of tweets were at the start of (first 10 weeks). This fact coupled with the fact that either because people were more scared to go out, or either because some restricting policies were promoted; could be the reason of this negative correlation. This correlation has a very low p-value of 0.0118, hence we can again refuse the null hypothesis at a 2% confidence level. On the other hand, we cant make any assumption on the retail movement,because of the p-value.

Rather unsurprisingly, there seems to be little correlation between the number of tweets by members of the US Congress and changes in mobility in their respective areas. However, something that is different across categories is the variance in the data. For example, the Parks & Recreation category has the highest variation followed by the Transit Station. It makes sense for the Residential and Workplaces categories to have low variance. One possible explanation is that Parks & Recreation encompasses a large variety of activities and settings. The outliers and difference in variance is a rather interesting phenomenon in this visualization. An interesting follow-up to this plot is the question: are the outliers across location categories the same congress members? It is possible that these are different outliers across each category. But there are 3 consistent outliers across the following categories: Grocery & Pharmacy, Parks & Recreation, Retail, and Transit Station.

```{r common_outliers, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide', fig.keep='all', message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
# Loading initial CSV
outliers <- tweets

# Filtering out based on where outliers appear visually in first correlation plot
outliers <- filter(outliers, (parks_percent_yearly_change > 75) | (parks_percent_yearly_change < -40))
outliers <- filter(outliers, (transit_stations_yearly_percent_change < -50))
outliers <- filter(outliers, (retail_and_recreation_percent_change_from_baseline < -30))
outliers <- filter(outliers, (grocery_and_pharmacy_yearly_percent_change < -20))

# Counting tweets by congress member and whether or not tweet was labeled as "covid-19" related
outliers <- outliers %>%
  group_by(full_name_of_member, covid_label) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

# Bar chart of tweets for outlier members
ggplot(outliers, 
  aes(x = reorder(full_name_of_member, -count), y = count, fill = covid_label)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
  xlab("Name of Congress Member") + 
  ylab("Number of Tweets")
```
The outliers in the aforementioned categories are in fact the same 3 outliers! Most of them have non-covid related tweets which could be why they are so influential. Mazie K. Hirono is senator from Hawaii, Brian Schatz is a senator from Ohio, and Ed Case is a representative from Hawaii. Since two senators are from Hawaii, this suggests a geographic element to the extreme changes in mobility relative to other representatives. That being said, having a member from Ohio casts doubt on a solely geographic explanation. We can look at the content of their tweets a bit more closely to uncover any potential patterns. Specifically, let us look at the content of their tweets for COVID adjacent terms (masks, vaccines, etc).

```{r congress_sentiment, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide', fig.keep='all', message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

    df[name] <- df %>% apply(1, function(row) {
    for (kw in keywords) {
      if (grepl(kw, tolower(row['tweet_content']), fixed = TRUE)) {
        return(TRUE);
      }
    }
    return(FALSE);
  });
  return(df);
}

                   cols = -c("full_name_of_member", "tweet_content"), 
                   names_to = "Sentiment_Category", 
                   values_to = "Present")

# Removing tweet itself and casting booleans to integers
df <- df[, !names(df) %in% c("tweet_content")]
df$Present <- as.numeric(df$Present)

df <- df %>% 
  group_by(full_name_of_member, Sentiment_Category) %>%

ggplot(df, aes(x = name, y = reorder(Sentiment_Category, +name))) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", orientation='y') + 
  facet_wrap(~full_name_of_member) +
  xlab("Number of Tweets in 2020") +
  ylab("Sentiment Category")
```
While it is no surprise that vaccines, testing, and masks were included among these outliers, it is interesting to note that social distancing is not as frequently mentioned. Perhaps this is a clue to the types of outreach and education that sticks with constituents. Masks and testing appear to be the most consistently frequent sentiments across the congress members' tweets. Herd immunity is also absent from these outliers' tweets.
